| [platformdirs](https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/) | Provides system paths for local data |
| [pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/) | Handles data validation for external files |

## 🛡️ Compatibility & Security

Bloodline has been tested with the anti-cheat software [Easy Anti-Cheat](https://www.easy.ac/) and [BattlEye](https://www.battleye.com/) without any issues. However, it remains possible that other anti-cheat solutions may flag the software.

Additionally, since the program utilizes global hotkeys via the [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library, some antivirus programs may trigger a warning due to the nature of keyboard hooks.
